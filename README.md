# Optimization of Coils Using CurveCWSFourier
## Axisymmetric coil winding surfaces for non-axisymmetric nuclear fusion devices

Optimization code and results obtained studying the viability of using coil winding surfaces in Stellarator optimization allong with testing codes for the implemented class CurveCWSFourier in SIMSOPT (https://github.com/hiddenSymmetries/simsopt - fork jb/curvecwsfourier).
All the obtained results can be found in the folder `results/`.

Research work performed for the Bachelor in Engineering Physics @ Instituto de Plasmas e Fusão Nuclear and Instituto Superior Técnico, Universidade de Lisboa.
